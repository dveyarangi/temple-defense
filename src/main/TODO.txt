	> Bind group of weapons to mouse
	> Disable/automate weapons on opposite temple side

* Optimization
	> Projectile pool?
	> Arithmetic optimization

 * Pulsating blob (bezier) spawning drops that spawn droplets...
 	> Droplets cover larger blobs while they close on the impact distance (bullet-wave analyzis)
 	> Spawner blob (different sizes)
 	> Blob properties (speed, armor, impact damage, size/mass, mission, etc) can be combined or inherited.
 	> Killed drop is reduced to smaller drops. which integrate into larger drop protection AI.
 	> Smaller drops can merge with larger ones to change their properties (size for sure).
 	> Drops shooting, accelerating, directing, pumping up, coordinating other drops
 	> Drops/terrain that "curls" drop movement trajectories. Perhaps, ability to construct
 	  "speedways" out of such curling points.
 	> dropplets creating the passways and flowing through
 	  them, while defending the curling points.

 * Mekanizms
 	> Build themself up. Connectable elements
 	> Primitive forms connect into a preset combo?
 	> Movers, weapons, brains

* Platforms:
	> Set base for temple actions
	> Command platform
		- central platform, coordinates sensor input and issues orders to other platforms
	> Construction platform
		- hosts construction bots.
		- construct and repair platforms.
		- construct resource pipes.
	> Incubator/kelia cells 
		- generates power and cpu
		- population limit
	> Harvester platform
		- hosts harvester bots
		- hosts lifeboats to extract refulgrims (!)
	> Sensor platform
		- hosts spybots
		- builds dispatchable static sensors
		- controls stoplight/directed sensors
	> Weapon platform
		- hosts weapons and attack bots.
	 
	> Temple autopilot AI.
	
* Create weapons and projectiles.
	> Weapon and projectile entities.
	> Hit physics, impact characteristics.
	> Temple weapon platforms.
	> Temple targeting interface.
	> Manual to automatic weapons transition.
	
* Enemies
	> Enemy structure, weapons and behavior
	> Some AI
	
* Landscape and other background
	> Sensor platform + sensors/spotlights/spybots
	
* Resources and construction
	> Resource/economy model
	> Resource pipelines/harvester platform + bots
	> Platform plug-in interface.
